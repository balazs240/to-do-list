## Interview Synthesis

Balazs experienced stress due to a large French project. The primary stressor was the amount of work required. He relied entirely on memory to track responsibilities, which caused him to feel rushed. Feeling rushed directly increased his stress level. The underlying issue is not simply workload, but the absence of a structured planning system that helps break large assignments into manageable steps ahead of time.

Key Insight:  
Large assignments become significantly more stressful when there is no external system to visualize, break down, and schedule the work over time.

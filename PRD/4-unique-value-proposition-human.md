## Unique Value Proposition 

For socially active, academically strong students balancing sports and school, our app student planner is a smart academic scheduling system for students, that aligns structured assignment stages with real daily routines. Unlike paper planners, it reminds you that if you dont do the work that the app set up for you in manageable bits you will have to do more and loss a postive streak that builds up when you do your work(e.g. if you dont finsh you have to do 2 more hours later). the app reduces stress during heavy academic weeks by planning around extracurriculars, adjusting effort based on grade goals, and preventing work from piling up unexpectedly.

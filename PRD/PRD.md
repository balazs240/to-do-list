# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
**Product Name:** Student Planner 
**One-Sentence Description:** A smart academic scheduling system that breaks large assignments into manageable bits based on grade goals and schedules them around extracurricular activities.  
**Positioning Statement:** For socially active student-athletes who balance heavy academic loads and sports, Student Planner is the only digital tool that makes the "cost of procrastination" visible while automatically structuring complex assignments, unlike static paper planners or generic task lists.

## Target User
**User Persona: Joel & Balazs (Representative Student-Athletes)**
*   **Context:** 14-year-old high school freshmen balancing sports (volleyball/basketball) and academic expectations.
*   **Key Constraints:** Increased difficulty in 9th-grade subjects (e.g., French); heavy daily sports schedules (3:00 PM - 5:00 PM); daily smartphone usage; reliance on memory or parental reminders.
*   **Goals:** Maintain high grades; participate in competitive sports; reduce stress during heavy weeks.
*   **Frustrations:** Overwhelmed by large projects (e.g., French projects); feeling "rushed" due to lack of a structured breakdown; high stress during weeks with multiple tests or assignments.

## Problem Statement
Joel and Balazs are motivated student-athletes who need a consistent, digital system to break large assignments into manageable steps because relying on memory leads to procrastination, feeling rushed, and high stress during peak academic weeks.  
**Evidence:** Interview data (e.g., Balazs' French project) shows that relying on memory for multi-stage assignments leads to starting late and feeling rushed, which results in increased stress and potential grade drops.

## Proposed Solution
The product solves the problem by providing a dynamic, rule-based scheduling system.
*   **Core Approach:** **Formula-Based Structured Breakdown.** The app automatically converts assignments into academic stages (Research → Outline → Draft → Review) based on rule-based templates for specific assignment types.
*   **Key Differentiator:** **Procrastination Cost Visibility.** If Joel skips a work session, the app immediately recalculates the remaining workload and displays a measurable consequence (e.g., "If you skip today, you'll need 2 more hours tomorrow").
*   **Smart Scheduling:** Work sessions are placed into available time slots around sports practices and after-school commitments.

## Scope
**Included in v1:**
*   Mobile-only application (iPhone-optimized).
*   Rule-based assignment stage templates.
*   Dynamic schedule adjustment based on sports/extracurricular slots.
*   Procrastination cost warning and behavior reinforcement (streaks).
*   Grade goals that adjust workload intensity.

**Explicitly Excluded from v1:**
*   Desktop/Web version.
*   Collaboration features for teachers/parents.
*   Social media sharing or student forums.

## Success Criteria
1.  **Zero Missed Deadlines:** Joel misses 0 assignments within the first month of app usage.
2.  **Improved Academic Performance:** Joel's average test and project scores show a measurable increase within the first semester.
3.  **Stress Reduction:** A self-reported decrease in "feeling rushed" or stressed during weeks with multiple deadlines.

## Vision Summary
The target users are students like Joel and Balazs—motivated 14-year-old athletes who struggle with the unpredictability of high school workloads. They rely on memory, which fails when large assignments like a French project collide with their intensive sports schedules. Existing paper planners are too static to help them visualize future workload. Student Planner fills this gap by dynamically scheduling academic "bits" around their specific daily routines and providing immediate feedback on the consequences of procrastination, ultimately ensuring they meet their grade goals without the last-minute stress.

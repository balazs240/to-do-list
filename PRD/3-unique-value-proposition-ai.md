## Core Solutions

- **Formula-Based Structured Breakdown**  
  The app automatically converts assignments into academic stages (e.g., Research → Outline → Draft → Review) using rule-based templates based on assignment type.

- **Goal-Based Workload Adjustment**  
  Students select their desired grade, and the app increases or maintains workload intensity accordingly by adding extra practice, refinement, or review sessions.

- **Smart Scheduling Around Extracurriculars**  
  Work sessions are automatically placed into available time slots based on sports and activities, eliminating reliance on memory.

- **Procrastination Cost Visibility**  
  If a student skips a scheduled session, the app recalculates the remaining workload and shows a clear warning (e.g., “If you skip today, you’ll need 2 more hours tomorrow”), making consequences immediate and measurable.

- **Behavior Reinforcement System**  
  Escalating reminders increase accountability, while positive streaks and a reduced stress indicator reward consistency and progress.

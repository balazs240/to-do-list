## Student Planner – Feature Brainstorm

Users can create a new assignment by choosing the type (e.g., test, essay, project) and entering the due date and estimated importance toward their grade.  

Users can set a target grade for each class and see how much effort they need to invest in upcoming assignments to stay on track.  

Users can automatically break a large assignment into clear stages like Research, Outline, Draft, and Review without having to figure out the steps themselves.  

Users can see their weekly schedule with academic work sessions automatically placed around sports practices and other commitments.  

Users can block off fixed activities like sports practice or games so their study sessions never conflict with them.  

Users can tap on any scheduled study session to see exactly what specific task they’re supposed to complete in that time.  

Users can mark a session as skipped and instantly see how their remaining workload increases, including a clear message showing the extra time required later.  

Users can receive reminders before each study session so they don’t rely on memory to start working.  

Users can view a “heavy week” warning when multiple tests or assignments stack up, along with suggestions to start earlier.  

Users can track streaks for completing planned study sessions to stay motivated during busy sports seasons.  

Users can quickly reschedule a session if a practice runs late, with the rest of the week automatically adjusting to fit everything in.  

Users can see a simple stress forecast that shows which upcoming days will feel intense based on total scheduled workload.

Users can sync their school calendar and assignment deadlines automatically from platforms like Google Classroom.  

Users can share their academic plan with parents or coaches so they can see upcoming heavy weeks and support better planning.  
## Must Have
1. Users can create a new assignment by choosing the type (e.g., test, essay, project) and entering the due date and estimated importance toward their grade. without this users wont be able to use the main feature of the app which is the planning for assigments and without the ability to put in the importance and due date the app wont be able to finish or it wont be able to give the result that the user wants.
2. Users can automatically break a large assignment into clear stages like Research, Outline, Draft, and Review without having to figure out the steps themselves. this is a must have cause without this the app will just be a simple to do list that has little use. this feature also reduces the amount of memory that the student has to use in order to do their work, which is one of the main features of the app.
3. Users can see their weekly schedule with academic work sessions automatically placed around sports practices and other commitments. without this feature the app wont be able to plan correctly for the assigment and lead to too many missed sessions which leads to unfinished work and the app being pointless 
4. Users can mark a session as skipped and instantly see how their remaining workload increases, including a clear message showing the extra time required later. without this feature users wont be able to feel motivated to do their work and will skip too many sessions because they can't see the measurable consequence of skiping sessions. which leads to unfinished work.
5. Users can receive reminders before each study session so they don’t rely on memory to start working. this a feature that is needed because one of the main points of the app is that students dont have to rely on memory.
## Should Have
1. Users can block off fixed activities like sports practice or games so their study sessions never conflict with them. this is kinda same as the one is must have but its fixed so its a bit less inportant because it be a one time thing but it would still be useful because it leads to less skipped sessions.  
2. Users can tap on any scheduled study session to see exactly what specific task they’re supposed to complete in that time. it is need to futher reduce the amount of memory neededd from the student but 2 from must have does that already in lesser way
3. Users can track streaks for completing planned study sessions to stay motivated during busy sports seasons. this is another way to motivated students but unlike the reminder this is just a basic streak that holds little value. 
4. Users can quickly reschedule a session if a practice runs late, with the rest of the week automatically adjusting to fit everything in. this is important because it leads to less skipped sessions but its still a one time thing and not needed for everyone.
5. Users can review a dashboard that shows upcoming deadlines, progress toward completion, and how close they are to their grade goals. this would be a useful feature to shoe the students that their work is paying off but they we see the same things in school. 
## Could Have
1. Users can set a target grade for each class and see how much effort they need to invest in upcoming assignments to stay on track.  this would be good if a students want to just pass but most people that would get this app would be people that want the best grades possible.
2. Users can view a “heavy week” warning when multiple tests or assignments stack up, along with suggestions to start earlier. this would be nice but not needed because the student would know they have a heavy week and it wont change anything to have a warning
3. Users can see a simple stress forecast that shows which upcoming days will feel intense based on total scheduled workload. this feature would be good if it wasn't just a forecast but it is so it has little use to the student
## Wont Have 
1.  Users can share their academic plan with parents or coaches so they can see upcoming heavy weeks and support better planning. the app is only for students, parents aren't inculded because the student chose how they wanna plan 
2.  users can sync their school calendar and assignment deadlines automatically from platforms like Google Classroom. the student will only put in assignment that they need help plannong for not every bit of work given.
